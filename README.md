# paper-template

This is my personal LaTeX template for writing papers. I originally created this template during my studies at HFU. It
is inspired by the ASME Conference Paper template, see [here](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/asmeconf).

## Usage

### Authors

To print a list of authors use:

```latex
\setAuthors{{John Doe, john.doe@example.com}, {Jane Doe, jane.doe@example.com}, {Catherine Parr, catherine.parr@example.com}}
```

All provided names will be rendered as a grid table directly under the title (and subtitle).
